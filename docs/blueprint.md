## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Analogous to the calming and supportive aspects of healthcare, choose a soft lavender (#D0BFFF). It avoids being overly clinical while maintaining a professional aesthetic.
- Background color: Near-white background (#FAFAFF) to ensure readability and create a sense of cleanliness.
- Accent color: Teal (#60D4B0) provides a subtle contrast and symbolizes reliability and efficiency.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) offers excellent readability and a modern, neutral aesthetic that supports the app's functionality.
- Use clear, recognizable icons for navigation and status indicators (e.g., location pins, vehicle symbols, user profiles).
- Maintain a clean, intuitive layout with clear hierarchy for forms, maps, and data displays. Prioritize mobile-friendliness and responsiveness.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance the user experience without distracting from the core functionality (e.g., map marker movements, status updates).
